ObelixAndCo Practical

Introduction

This project, inspired by the "Asterix & Obelix" universe, involves creating a simulation where Romans attempt to economically disrupt a Gallic village. By implementing various coding concepts like inheritance and encapsulation, we model interactions between different characters and environments. The goal is to build a structured and functional project using object-oriented principles in C#.

Goals

Learn and apply inheritance to create hierarchical relationships between classes.

Use getters and setters to encapsulate and manage data within objects.

Develop a modular and maintainable codebase.

Practice working with project architectures, version control, and testing.

Key Concepts

Inheritance

English: Inheritance allows us to define a base class (e.g., Person) and then create derived classes (e.g., Hunter, Fisher, Sculptor) that inherit properties and methods from the base class. This helps reduce code duplication and makes the code more modular.
Testing

Place all test files in the Tests folder.

Ensure tests do not interfere with the main program.

Comments & Reflections

Strengths

Reinforced understanding of OOP concepts like inheritance and encapsulation.

Learned to structure a project with proper architecture and adhere to submission guidelines.

Weaknesses

Managing multiple files and ensuring proper namespace usage can be challenging.

Handling edge cases in getters and setters needs more practice.

Conclusion

This project serves as an excellent introduction to advanced C# programming concepts while also emphasizing clean code and maintainability. By completing it, we gain not only technical proficiency but also the discipline to follow strict project guidelines.
